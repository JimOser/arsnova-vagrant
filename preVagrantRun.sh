# According to vagrant google group forum there are problems with a cloud guest and rsyncing
# Here is one solution: https://github.com/smerrill/vagrant-rsync-back
# Do a manually rsync from the host side by:   $ vagrant rsync-back
# It may require doing twice:   $ vagrant rsync-back
# Note: This was needed with vagrant 1.6.3
# Rsync capabilites in both directions are suppose to be part of vagrant, so
# in the future this plugin might not be necessary.
